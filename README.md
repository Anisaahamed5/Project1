# Project1
First project for Quickstart

## Name

Anisa Ahamed

## Description

I designed a personal business website to promote my art. I have four tabs in my nav bar, which include a homepage, shopping page, contact page, and an about me page. My homepage contains my carousel, my shopping page contains pictures of products (this is the section that utilized the bootstrap grid), my contact page contains the form, and the about me page tells web users a little bit about myself and also includes links to social media. 

## How to Use

Users can navigate through this site by using the navbar. The homepage has the name of my page and a carousel of some art pieces that I have done. The shopping page will be used for purchases. The contact page has a form to fill out and inputs are required by the user. The form is also active on formspree. The about me page has social media icons that link to my personal social media pages. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Ideas for future improvement
1. I would like to experiment more with color when designing the website and make the page more visually appealing.
2. I would like to create real links to the pictures in the shopping section so that I can sell my products.
3. I would like change the layout of the website to create a page in which the user can scroll and view all of the information. This means that the navbar would keep you on the same page, but jump to the section of information of your choosing. I like these kinds of websites better since they appear to transition from topic to topic in a more fluid manner. 
4. I would create more social media and link them to icons to have more networkability.
